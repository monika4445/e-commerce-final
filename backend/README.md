# Skeleton of an E-commerce App

I have developed a comprehensive API template that can serve as a solid foundation for building robust e-commerce applications. 
The API offers a range of essential features, including user management, product management, cart functionality, and authentication.
Each user of the API is empowered to access and browse product information seamlessly, with no impediments whatsoever. 
Additionally, every user has access to a unique cart that allows them to track and manage their product selections conveniently.
Moreover, only the admin user possesses the authorization to perform crucial tasks like creating, editing, or deleting products.
In summary, this API template provides a strong basis for creating versatile e-commerce applications that can be tailored to specific business requirements.


This API template can be used to create an e-commerce application that supports user management, product management, and cart functionality. 

Here are some possible ways that the API could be used:

1. Build a web application: The API could be used as the backend for a web application that allows users to browse and purchase products.
The web application would interact with the API to retrieve and display product information, manage user authentication, and update user cart information.

2. Use as a starting point for new projects: The API template that you have built could be used as a starting point for new e-commerce projects. 
Developers could fork the repository and modify it to meet the specific requirements of their project.

3. Learn best practices: The API template could be used as a learning resource for developers who are new to building APIs. 
The code could be studied to learn about best practices for building APIs, such as how to structure routes, interact with a database, and implement authentication.
